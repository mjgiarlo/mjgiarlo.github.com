What happens to a digital object defined?[^1]

Does its identifier dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or its relationships fester like a sore--
And then run?
Do its bits rot like meat?
Or become overwritten--
like some throw-away sheet?

Maybe its metadata just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it fade into code?
