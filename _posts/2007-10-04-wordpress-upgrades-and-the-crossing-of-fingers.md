On Monday I woke up with a very mild and very annoying bronchial infection.  Doctor Me prescribed two days of rest, relaxation, and chicken soup.  Where "chicken soup" is "finally dropping the unreasonably expensive and embarrassingly outdated web hosting package at Speakeasy and transferring all of my domains and content to Dreamhost," that is.  I am now paying less than a third of what I had been for a hell of a lot more features.  And, I must say, administering DNS records, transferring files, and upgrading long-neglected software is rather amusing when you're loopy and feverish.

My experiences thus far with Dreamhost are very promising.  I'm impressed but perhaps that's because I've been in the web hosting ghetto for so long.  I understand there will very likely be downtime and sluggishness -- that I can deal with.  Being shackled to 1999 technologies for $30/mth, while my e-mails go unanswered, not so much.

I upgraded both Technosophia and my wife's <a href="/elizabeth/" target="_blank">blog</a> to the latest WordPress release (2.3) from something ridiculous like 2.0.3.  In doing so, I also switched to the svn upgrade configuration Ryan Eby <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/easy-wordpress-upgrades-with-svn/" target="_blank">detailed</a> a while back.

I crossed my fingers and it turns out the <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/unapi-wordpress-plug-in/" target="_blank">unAPI server plug-in</a> still works in WP2.3.  Huzzah!  Not sure if it works in the 2.1 or 2.2 branches, but I suspect it does.
