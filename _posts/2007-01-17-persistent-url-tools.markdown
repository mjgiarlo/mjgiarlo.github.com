I've posted a couple <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/persistent-url-bookmarker/" target="_blank">new tools</a> during the past couple days.  One is an update of <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/staff/smith.htm" target="_blank">Devon Smith</a>'s <a href="http://purl.org/net/linkpurl" target="_blank">LinkPURL</a> extension for Firefox 2.0.  

The other is an ultra-lightweight Wordpress plugin that embeds a linkpurl link tag for auto-discovery (so bookmarking agents can detect and grab the persistent URL rather than the impersistent URL up in the addressbar).  

Based on a discussion in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib" target="_blank">#code4lib</a> earlier today, I realize that there are a lot of important questions, not to mention serious doubts, about persistent identifiers.  I flip-flop on their utility myself, so I found the discussion very useful.  (Thanks, <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/" target="_blank">edsu</a>!)  Maybe I'll write a post or two about persistent identifiers to flesh my thoughts out.
