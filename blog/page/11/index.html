  <div class="entry-content"><p>I assure you that Access 2006 was longer than one day, I really do.Â  My (!*#@$ laptop had the nerve to go and die on me the second night of the conference, after I&#8217;d resolved to take copious notes during each talk, and had mostly kept my promise.Â  I&#8217;ll be posting some more notes when I get the machine fixed up, assuming my memory&#8217;s still relatively fresh (and my damn hard drive lives through the surgery).</p>

<p>Normally I might just give up and say &#8220;why bother?&#8221;, since the conference will likely be old news by then.Â  Then again, this is the Access conference we&#8217;re talking about; it&#8217;s not likely to be a passÃ© topic anytime soon.Â  For a different sort of account of how Access stays with a person, read <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/a-lost-week" target="_blank">Dan Chudnov&#8217;s post</a>.Â </p>

<p>In the meantime, there is photographic evidence that I was at the conference (or at least <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calvinm/269190089/" target="_blank">out drinking in Ottawa</a> around the same time).</p>

<p>More to come&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Day one of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/">Access 2006 conference</a> is winding down.  Two groups of hackers (by trade or in spirit) gathered earlier today at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/?page_id=13">Hackfest and Ad Hockfest</a>, determined to work on a select few of the excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://hackfest.kicks-ass.net/home/suggestion">project suggestions</a>.  The experience was entirely new to me, but not uncomfortably so.  I was in a group (with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/">pbinkley</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinclarke.info/weblog/">ksclarke</a>, tholbroo, and BigD) that worked on a Scriptaculous- and Cocoon-powered METS editor, a project similar to one I may be working on at Princeton.  The most rewarding aspect, though, was meeting fellow library technologists and hearing about the interesting, and sometimes interestingly uninteresting :), projects they&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>Despite that, today was a bit of a bummer for me.  My wife&#8217;s and my recent move from Seattle to New Jersey was exhausting, and I was not looking forward to spending a potential day of rest, between relocation and starting my new job, sitting on a bus for twelve hours.  I woke up with a painful headache that wouldn&#8217;t go away, which rendered me basically useless until Hackfest was over and I took some pills back in my hotel room. My laptop was behaving badly when the day began, and I spent an hour or two trying to figure out why we Windows users couldn&#8217;t connect to the wireless network.  My single-minded persistence paid off when I finally got it working, but in retrospect I probably could have spent that time more wisely (and just jacked in to the ethernet).  Anyhoo, enough belly-aching for now.</p>

<p>I wound up skipping the opening reception tonight because of how crappy I felt, and instead found a cool Irish pub &#8211; the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.auldedubliner.com/">Aulde Dubliner Pour House</a> &#8211; a couple blocks away from my hotel.  It was exactly how I would have pictured an Irish pub in Canada.  Hockey was on every television; the Tragically Hip was playing loudly; and folks were quick to offer a friendly &#8220;Cheers!&#8221;  It was quite relaxing, thanks in some part to the Kilkenny Cream Ale.</p>

<p>All in all, a good beginning to the conference in spite of my malaise.  I&#8217;m looking forward to reading other folks&#8217; accounts of their Access 2006 experiences over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/planet.php">Planet Access</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is unAPI?  Why should you care about it?</p>

<p>Read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue48/chudnov-et-al/">Introducing unAPI</a>, in Ariadne issue 48, for answers to those questions&#8230; and more!  Here&#8217;s the obligatory snippet:</p>

<blockquote>Common Web tools and techniques cannot easily manipulate library resources. While photo sharing, link logging, and Web logging sites make it easy to use and reuse content, barriers still exist that limit the reuse of library resources within new Web services.  To support the reuse of library information in Web 2.0-style services, we need to allow many types of applications to connect with our information resources more easily. One such connection is a universal method to copy any resource of interest. Because the copy-and-paste paradigm resonates with both users and Web developers, it makes sense that users should be able to copy items they see online and paste them into desktop applications or other Web applications. Recent developments proposed in weblogs and discussed at technical conferences suggest exactly this: extending the &#8216;clipboard&#8217; copy-and-paste paradigm onto the Web. To fit this new, extended paradigm, we need to provide a uniform, simple method for copying rich digital objects out of any Web application.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have idly been considering the ontologies proposed by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> in <em>The Thought</em>, and revisited in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a>&#8217;s <em>Objective Knowledge,</em> in which there are three distinct realms of existence.  Moreover, I wonder how envisioning such ontologies from an object-oriented perspective might provide a structured way of thinking about existence without need of dualistic theories.</p>

<p>A good question to raise is &#8220;what particular reason might you have for thinking that an object-oriented perspective is at all relevant here?&#8221;  I have no answer for that other than &#8220;if we can mash-up web services, why not theoretical frameworks?&#8221;  A glib and dorky answer, I admit, but I challenge the reader to name but one discipline where this sort of haphazard duct-taping of theory does not occur.  But I digress.</p>

<p>In both of these ontologies, the first realm is that of physical objects: things one can see, smell, taste, touch, or hear.  (This is an oversimplification, of course.  One risk is suggesting that subjective perceptions, such as hallucinations, are objective phenomena perceptible by others.  If I see a flying pink elephant and no one else does, is it &#8220;real?&#8221;  I also run the risk of hinting that imperceptible, physical entities do not exist.)</p>

<p>The second realm consists of mental entities, though Popper and Frege diverge at this point.  Whereas Popper thinks <em>all</em> non-physical entities live in the second realm, Frege confines the second realm to only those non-physical entities which consist in private or subjective ideas.  Take the example of the concept of <em>pi</em> and my belief that &#8220;beer is good.&#8221;  Popper would say that both of these entities belong in the second realm of his ontology: Frege would say that only the second is a second-realm entity.</p>

<p>The latter notion makes more sense in light of Frege&#8217;s third realm, that of <em>objective</em>, non-physical entities.  A good example is the Pythagorean Theorem which exists independently of the mind of Pythagoras; although Pythagoras discovered the Theorem, it was not a private or subjective idea of his invention; it was merely his <em>expression</em> of an otherwise objective property of the physical world (i.e., first realm), which anyone of a certain intellect might have discovered upon due thought and experimentation.</p>

<p>Popper lumps the Pythagorean Theorem, which Frege considers to be an objective entity, in with other subjective entities such as my idea that beer is a tasty beverage.  Popper sees the third realm as &#8220;the totality of all human thought embodied in human artefacts,&#8221; a realm of <em>objective knowledge</em>.  However, does he mean to suggest that a subjective, second-realm idea committed to a physical, first-realm object becomes something ontologically different upon their combination?  Do these entities warrant their own realm of existence?  Popper&#8217;s vision of third realm sounds more like an interface between the first and second realms than like a realm all its own.  An example of such an interface is human perception, which allows us to form second-realm ideas about first-realm entities by virtue of our innate sensory and cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>Frege&#8217;s and Popper&#8217;s views may be simplified by thinking about ontological realms in terms of object orientation as this perspective defines clear and structured relationships that are applicable to such thought.  Issues such as the nature and number of interfaces between the realms and the consumption and immensity of space in the realms, for instance, may be addressed with conceptual apparatus that already exist in the object-oriented perspective.  An ontology consisting of <em>one object-oriented realm, </em>rather than a number of realms, also has the benefit of emerging from the murky depths of dualism, for those who are inclined to reject dualistic theories.</p>

<p>An object-oriented ontology based on Frege&#8217;s conceptual divisions, summarized very briefly, would view: the physical realm as the main container object, that which contains all other objects, consisting of electro-magnetic radiation, matter, and physical forces; mental realms as distinct member objects of the physical realm, particular and distinct configurations of energy and matter resulting in concepts that are physically imperceptible; a &#8220;realm&#8221; of public, objective, non-physical entities as <em>properties of first-realm objects</em>, which are perceptible in the first realm and deducible (<em>a la</em> Pythagoras) in the second realm.</p>

<p>For a better thought out alternative object-oriented ontology, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.interaction-design.org/mads/articles/object_orientation_redefined.html">Object Orientation Redefined</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title makes this post sound rather more interesting than it is.</p>

<p>In light of <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2006/08/02/going-to-princeton-code4lib/" target="_blank">my recent announcement</a>, I figured I would make sure that the three of you who are reading this &#8211; assuming my mother and wife are still following along &#8211; have bookmarked the durable URLs.Â  (Durable, at least, to the extent that they will live on after my 9/20 resignation date at UW.)Â  The persistent URL for Technosophia is <a href="http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog">http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog</a>.Â  The URL for Technosophia&#8217;s feed is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia">http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be moving Technosophia and my CV (which is of great and obviousÂ value to the internet tubes) to a new server in the coming weeks, hopefully with very little disruption (especially for those who&#8217;ve bookmarked the durable URLs).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Though I will miss Seattle and my colleagues at the University of Washington, I am leaving to work at Princeton University Libraries as a digital library developer.Â  I&#8217;m looking very forward to helping design their repository infrastructure and building repository tools.Â  This is a fabulous opportunity to continue my work on digital libraries, and for my wife and I toÂ return home to the Garden State.</p>

<p>Still, itÂ will beÂ difficult to leave an area we&#8217;ve grown so fond of, and especially to leave the family and friends we have up here.Â  There&#8217;s a certain bittersweetnessÂ I experience with every move, and this is perhaps both the most bitter <em>and</em> the sweetest I&#8217;ve felt about a move yet;Â I can think of no other cities I&#8217;d rather liveÂ than Seattle.Â  ButÂ that ol&#8217; Dorothy was right: there is no place like home.Â  And home, in this case, happens to be the place where our closest family members and most of our friends reside, and also an area with perhaps the greatest number of career opportunities for a digital librarian-up-and-comer like me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like toÂ expressÂ appreciation forÂ the code4lib community, and especially the #code4lib IRC channel.Â  Without them, I likely would never have learned of this position.Â  I&#8217;ve been meaning to post about how code4lib has changed my thinking about the profession of librarianship; but suffice it to say that I feel indebted to this wonderfully resourceful and visionary community for broadening, to a great extent,Â my perspective on library technology.Â  I&#8217;ve benefitted greatly from their knowledge and diverse points of view, and have felt welcome in the community from the outset.Â </p>
