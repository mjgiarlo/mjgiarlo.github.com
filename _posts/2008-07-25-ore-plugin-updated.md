I've been using my time at <a href="http://barcamp.org/RepoCamp" target="_blank">RepoCamp</a> today to get the OAI-ORE <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/ore-wordpress-plug-in/" target="_blank">plugin</a> for WordPress <a href="http://african.lanl.gov/ovalnet/validate.jsp" target="_blank">validating</a> again.Â  I'm having some trouble using the validator so I say that with some diffidence.Â  But the latest code which is now checked in to the WordPress plugins svn repo ought to be close, if not fully conformant, to the 0.9 version of the ORE spec.

I'm not sure the plugin is really useful; it's just an Atom feed of all posts and pages in a WP instance.Â  I can think of some ways to make this more useful, by allowing blog authors to create their own aggregations, pulling in content outside of the particular instance.Â  I am certain that others can come up with even better uses.Â  I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks to Jay Datema for <a href="http://www.bookism.org/open/2008/07/17/repurposing-metadata/" target="_blank">prodding</a> me a bit, if indirectly.
