I was stoked to see our <a href="http://library.princeton.edu/hr/positions/JobLibDigitalInitiativesCoord.html" target="_blank">Digital Initiatives Coordinator</a> position posted earlier today.  We have been without a full-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_rank#Field_or_Senior_officers" target="_blank">field officer</a> for nearly eight months, though <a href="http://weblog.kevinclarke.info/" target="_blank">Kevin Clarke</a> (lead programmer) has served with distinction -- and with nary a complaint!  (Well, okay, there may have been some complaints, but he always had a smile on his face.)

Here are some reasons you might consider this position:

<ul>
	<li>A chance to get in on the ground floor -- our team is still undecided on many important issues, so you would have the opportunity to shape the organization.</li>
	<li>Work with a broad range of technologies, such as Java, Ruby, XQuery, XForms, native XML databases, Solr, and more.</li>
	<li>Assist in the ongoing effort to select repositories for various use cases  -- we're evaluating DSpace, several Fedora front-ends, and the X-Hive/DB native XML database</li>
	<li>Many rare and beautiful library collections.</li>
	<li>Great location -- it hardly seems like New Jersey!</li>
	<li>Lead the digital collections team, currently consisting of four librarian programmers and five digitization gurus.</li>
        <li>Forge ties with one of the finest faculties in academia.</li>
	<li>Comprehensive benefits package -- 24 days vacation, the whole insurance kit and kaboodle, and so on.</li>
	<li>Uncommon amount of support (financial and otherwise) for professional development.</li>
	<li>... and you get to work with me!  But seriously, the great team we have assembled has been a big part of why I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Princeton.</li>
</ul>

You can get a sense of the work we've been doing by browsing our <a href="http://diglib.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Collections</a>, though that's only the tip of the iceberg, and the site will be overhauled in the coming months.
