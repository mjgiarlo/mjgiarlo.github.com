I confess; I'm a fan of graphic novels, many of which are published by DC imprints <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/">Vertigo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dccomics.com/wildstorm/">WildStorm</a>.  Wanting to keep up with the newest titles without having to make weekly stops to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zanaducomics.com/z2.html">local comic shop</a> -- which is a nifty shop, but why get up off your butt to do something if you don't have to? -- I went a-searchin' for some RSS feeds and found naught.  There may be some out there, and I'd be happy to hear of them.

In the meantime, however, I've thrown together a quick and dirty screen-scraper (36 lines of PHP, partly inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codebeach.com/tutorials/screen-scrapping-rss-php.asp">Screen Scraping Your Way Into RSS</a>) that grabs an appropriate "new comics" page on the DC website, and generates an RSS feed from relevant discovered information.  To keep abreast of new Vertigo or WildStorm comics, subscribe to the following feeds (which should be updated on a monthly basis):
<blockquote><a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WildstormComics">http://feeds.feedburner.com/WildstormComics</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://feeds.feedburner.com/WildstormComics">Sub with Bloglines</a>)
<a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/VertigoComics">http://feeds.feedburner.com/VertigoComics</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloglines.com/sub/http://feeds.feedburner.com/VertigoComics">Sub with Bloglines</a>)</blockquote>
Enjoy, and spread the goodness if you wish.
