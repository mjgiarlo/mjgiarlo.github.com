While doing some reading for a little <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2009/schedule#hcal10">talk</a> my colleague, <a href="http://inkdroid.org/ehs">Ed Summers</a>, and I are giving at <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2009">code4lib 2009</a>, I came across a paragraph that sparked a crazy thought.  So crazy that it's not crazy at all.  So not crazy that I am sure other people have thought of it.  But nonetheless, here I am writing about it just in case.

From Sarah Currier's <a href="http://www.elearning.ac.uk/features/sword">paper</a> on <a href="http://www.swordapp.org/">SWORD</a> (emphasis mine):<blockquote>One of the most frequently cited barriers to academics depositing their teaching materials into repositories is the keystroke-count involved in logging into a repository, uploading the resource, creating metadata, perhaps selecting a licence, and publishing the resource. It was a quick win, therefore, to create a drag-and-drop desktop tool to allow a single keystroke deposit of resources, including multiple resources in one action. For a repository that supports <b>automatic metadata generation</b>, administrative metadata can be created at the point of entry to the repository without the user needing to create any.</blockquote> 

And I wondered how many repositories supported automatic metadata generation.  I wondered how many repositories supported automatic generation of <em>rich</em> metadata.  And lastly I wondered, might this be a more or less natural role for catalogers: augmenting stub metadata records or doing original cataloging for institutional repository deposits?  Especially at a time when many of them are being reclassified as acquisitions specialists or digital projects managers?

Potential issues and questions:<ul>
	<li>Author ignorance: Maybe catalogers are already doing this and I'm a moron?</li>
	<li>Scale: Is it realistic to expect to be able to "keep up" with repository deposits?</li>
	<li>Granularity: Does cataloging at the level of articles, and perhaps at even finer granularities, introduce challenges?</li>
	<li>Duplication: If pre-prints are cataloged in the IR, for instance, will they need to be cataloged again later?</li>
	<li>... there are others I thought of on my commute this morning but have since forgotten them.  Feel free to add comments.</li>
</ul>

I will admit here that I've been somewhat out of the (academic) institutional repository space a while, and cataloging is something I don't share thoughts about very often because my exposure is limited to having taken one course a couple years ago.  

I assume there's a body of research about this out there somewhere but I figured I'd post this anyway.
