I've decided to use this blog partly to write about work-related points of interest but also to futz around with blogging technologies and such.Â

Thanks to a couple of very helpful posts and some neat WordPress hacks

Technosophia is now unAPI-1.0- and COinS-PMH-compliant!Â  Under each post there are shortcut links to view the Dublin Core, MODS, and other unAPI formats (should I add them in at a later date).

It started dawning on me today just how useful unAPI might turn out to be, mostly because I re-read <a title="unAPI Slides in PDF" href="http://onebiglibrary.net/files/20060215-c4lc-unapi-opa.pdf" target="_blank">Dan Chudnov's slides</a> for the first time seeing his talk live at <a title="code4lib conference" href="http://code4lib.org/2006" target="_blank">code4libCon</a> '06.

Addendum the first: This is also OpenSearch 1.1-compliant, thanks to: <a title="OpenSearch 1.1 for WordPress 2.0" href="http://www.williamsburger.com/wb/archives/opensearch-v-1-1" target="_blank">http://www.williamsburger.com/wb/archives/opensearch-v-1-1</a>.Â  Excellent.

Addendum the second: I'm also PURL-friendly - <a href="http://purl.org/maint/linkpurl.html">http://purl.org/maint/linkpurl.html</a>.Â  Well, at least if you have a friendly client (read: not IE).
