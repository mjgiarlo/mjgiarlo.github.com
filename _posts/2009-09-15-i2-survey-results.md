I <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/06/20/i2-survey/">wrote</a> in June that the I2 subgroup surveyed "repository managers to determine the current practices and needs of the repository community regarding institutional identifiers. Results from the survey will inform a set of use cases that will be shared with the community, and that are expected to drive the development of a new standard for institutional identifiers."

The survey closed in July, and the subgroup spent August writing a report on the survey results.  That report is now <a href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=2773">final</a> and it's available to the public.  Feedback may be sent to our (woefully underutilized) public <a href="http://www.niso.org/lists/i2info/">i2info</a> mailing list, left as a comment on this post, or e-mailed to me privately which I can forward to our internal list.

The next step is to build upon the report to draw yet more conclusions from the data -- there's an awful lot there -- and flesh out some repository use cases for institutional identifiers.  The I2 core group is moving quickly towards finalizing identifier metadata elements so that a standard may be drafted, and I think having some use cases documented will help drive the standard in a direction the community can get behind.

Onward and upward.
