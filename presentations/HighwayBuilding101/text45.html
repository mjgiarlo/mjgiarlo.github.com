<h1><font color=#333399> The NJDH SAN</font></h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>The NJDH SAN was initially configured to contain the repository server, a massive disk array with seven terabytes of usable storage, and a twenty terabyte tape library for backup</h2>
<li><h2>In addition to the hardware, the NJDH SAN also includes Hierarchical Storage Management software, which essentially allows the repository server to address both the disk array <i>and the tape library</i> as though they were connected disks.  The HSM software runs on a separate server and tracks where objects actually exist (on disk, on tape, or both), and permits systems administrators to more effectively manage the storage system.  The policy is to store all presentation-form datastreams on disk, and release the rarely-accessed archival datastreams to tape</h2>
