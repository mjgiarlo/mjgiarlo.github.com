<h1><b><i><font color=#FF9966>Term-weighting </b></i></font></h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>Definition – The assignment of numerical values to distinguish the “value” of document (and query) descriptors, more commonly known as “index terms.”</h2>
<li><h2>Example – “History of England” versus “English Language”</h2>
<ul><li>Perhaps “England” is a descriptor of both works
<li>Since the history of England presumably has more to do with England than the English language does – the latter would likely be more concerned with linguistic properties than the nation of England – one would want to assign a higher weight value to the term for the former document
