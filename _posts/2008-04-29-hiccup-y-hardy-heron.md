In spite of how irksome I find "oh hai i upgrayded!" posts, I'm about to be guilty of same.

I upgraded my Optiplex GX620 from Gutsy to <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron">Hardy</a> yesterday afternoon and it seemed to go as smoothly as it did on my HP box at home.Â  All looked a-okay this morning until, upon returning from a meeting, my display was all funky and jerky and laggy.Â  The right edges of my windows were uniformly screwy -- I would have to click about an inch to the left of whatever I wanted to click on -- and the right and left edges of the screen caused visual trails when I dragged windows around.Â  (And this has nothing to do with my usual breakfast of bacon and psychedelics.)Â  This wasn't the first time I've run into problems with compiz/beryl and Ubuntu and so I was hopeful that things could be easily remedied.

I was still able to get around a bit and I found a <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide#Removing_Mesa_drivers" target="_blank">Hardy installation guide</a> that fixed me all up (I hope).

I should probably note that the Optiplex in question has an ATI Radeon X600 series video card.

Pining for the visual trails,

Mike from Arlington

P.S. Ubuntu, I still &hearts; you.
