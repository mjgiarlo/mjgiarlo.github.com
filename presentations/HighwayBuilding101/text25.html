<ul><li><h2>“Amberfish is offered as open source software under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL).”</h2>
<li><h2>“Amberfish is general purpose text retrieval software. Its distinguishing features are indexing/search of semi-structured text (i.e. both free text and multiply nested fields), built-in support for XML documents using the Xerces library, structured queries allowing generalized field/tag paths, hierarchical result sets (XML only), automatic searching across multiple databases (allowing modular indexing), efficient indexing, and relatively low memory requirements during indexing (and the ability to index documents larger than available memory). Other features include Boolean queries, right truncation, phrase searching, relevance ranking, support for multiple documents per file, incremental indexing, and easy integration with other UNIX tools.”</h2>
