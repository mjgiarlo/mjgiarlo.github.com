Here's a list of questions I hope to grapple with.  And, yes, I am fixating on terms a bit here.  I blame it on the philosophy courses.

*   What is a digital library architecture?
*   When we talk about digital library architectures do we normally tend to talk about systems?
*   Is it wise to have a system-centric view of digital library architectures -- i.e., "just install Fedora/DSpace/Drupal/aDORe!" -- or should we think instead in terms of APIs, standards, and access requirements?  Maybe this is a false dichotomy.
*   Do digital library architectures need to be so esoteric, or may they reduce to garden-variety information architectures?  Formulated otherwise: are our problems really that special?
*   How do repositories and digital library architectures intersect?
*   Would a UNIX filesystem w/ certain naming and directory conventions suffice as a digital library architecture?  Formulated otherwise: would the California Digital Library's curation microservices suffice?
*   How do HTTP, web architecture, linked data, RDF-based ontologies, and REST help us with digital library architectures?
*   How might messaging architectures such as AMQP, XMPP, and OpenSRF fit into the digital library problem space?
*   Am I overthinking this/fixating too much on the phrase "digital library architecture?"

I've been trying to track down relevant literature on digital library architecture and have found a modest number of articles.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Happy holidays, folks.
