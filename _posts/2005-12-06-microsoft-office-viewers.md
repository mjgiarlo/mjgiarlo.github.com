<p>For users who have neither access to Microsoft Office nor desire to dive headfirst into <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>*, Microsoft provides freely downloadable viewers for Office documents. <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA010449811033.aspx">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA010449811033.aspx</a> Most of these viewers are at the Office 2003 version, e.g., Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Others, like Access, are at the 2002 version. * For the record, though, OpenOffice 2.0 is fabulous. I've exclusively been using OO at home for at least a year or two, and the new version is <em>tres magnifique</em>.
