My agenda for the first few months of 2010 is becoming clearer. Consider this a snapshot of the things that will be crossing my desk and bouncing around my mind.

*   [Reviewing digital library platforms](https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/01/e-content-stewardship-program-kick-off/) for the e-Content Stewardship Council
*   Reviewing functional requirements for an institution-wide repository of electronic records

    ](https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/01/data-management-discussion/)
*   Evaluating the [DLT](http://dlt.its.psu.edu/) [archival storage prototype](https://lib.stanford.edu/files/PSU_Archival_Storage_Prototype_Final_Report_External%20v5.pdf) and joining the technical team of the Data Storage Working Group

My plate is rather full; fortunately, for now, I've got a big appetite.
