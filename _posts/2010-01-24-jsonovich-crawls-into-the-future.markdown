For those of you who use JSONovich rather than, e.g., <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10869">JSONView</a>, I've tweaked the plugin (now at version 1.3) to work with Firefox 3.6.  

I updated the version up on the Mozilla site as well, but things tend to stay in the sandbox for months at a time.  (For instance, I submitted version 1.2 back in November, and it's not yet available.)  Feel free to install via <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/json-in-firefox/">my page</a>.
