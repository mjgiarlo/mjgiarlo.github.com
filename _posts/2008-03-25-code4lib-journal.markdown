... meanwhile, the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/" target="_blank">Code4Lib Journal</a> has published its <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issue2" target="_blank">second issue</a> and boy is it packed with articles; <a href="http://www.library.nd.edu/daiad/morgan/" target="_blank">Eric Lease Morgan</a>, Coordinating Editor of the issue, does a bang-up job on the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/71" target="_blank">introduction</a> (though the title has effectively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Than_a_Feeling" target="_blank">Bostonroll</a>'d me).
<blockquote>Each article in this issue has a little bit of something for all who call themselves a librarian or work in a library. Each identifies some sort of library problem to be addressed, and offers one or more solutions. Many are complete with code snippets. After all, this is Code4Lib.

For example, people in public service may be interested in Edward M. Corrado and Kathryn A. Frederickâ€™s review of database-driven <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/47">subject guide applications</a>. Kenneth Furuta and Michele Potter describe a simple <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/45">help system</a> that brings librarians running to the reference desk. Margaret Mellinger and Kim Griggs explain how library resources can be organized into <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/63">course pages</a> without the need of HTML knowledge and yet sport Web 2.0 features. Nancy Fried Foster, Nora Dimmock, and Alison Bersani shed light on <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/53">participatory design</a>.

For those of us who enjoy cataloging and metadata issues, Jonathan Gorman outlines how he modified VUFind to exploit Wikipedia and cataloging <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/57">authority records</a> to enhance information about authors in a library catalog. Chris Freeland, Martin Kalfatovic, Jay Paige, and Marc Crozier illustrate a different use of <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/52">Library of Congress Subject Headings</a> by integrating place names with Google Maps. Carol Jean Godby, Devon Smith and Eric Childress describe a technique for <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/54">crosswalking</a> just about any metadata format into just about any other metadata format.

For the systems librarian in you, Dan Scott and Kevin Beswick share how they used Linux live CDs customized as kiosk browsers to provide laptops as <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/49">â€˜quick lookupâ€™ stations</a> at their library. Andrew Darby takes advantage of the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/46">Google Calendar API</a> to easily manage the display of library hours. Jody DeRidder exploits Google <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/43">sitemap technology</a> and static HTML pages to make content in the â€œdeep Webâ€ more accessible. We hope you find these articles useful, stimulating, and relevant to your daily working lives.</blockquote>
I  am ashamed to admit that I have not yet finished the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issue1" target="_blank">first issue</a>, so I now have pages upon pages to read.  Ordinarily when I am behind on my reading I wind up letting bits fall by the wayside but the material largely looks too good to ignore.

Congratulations to Editorial Committees past and present and to the <a href="http://code4lib.org/" target="_blank">community</a> on the whole!
