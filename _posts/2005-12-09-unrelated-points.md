I've been hearing a lot about the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller">Ruby programming language</a> lately, and specifically about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. After looking at different strategies to get this sucker up and running, I decided to take the path of the cowardly and install <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=904">Instant Rails</a>. I am still trying to figure out what the heck it is and does, but a lot of people seem to like it for throwing together quick, powerful, open, and structured web applications.

On a related "gaining in popularity" note is S5, an <a href="http://www.s5presents.com/">open-source, open-standards application for producing web-enabled presentations</a>. No more must one be a slave to that wicked master, Microsoft Powerpoint (or OO.o Impress, for that matter, or whatever you crazy Mac heathens use). Now one can produce a web presentation using S5, which puts all the material into one XHTML file. It uses CSS and JavaScript for styles and functionality, respectively. I think I might check that out as well. Counterpoint: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice 2.0</a>'s Impress application does a bang-up job as well.

And finally, what is all this talk of the Web 2.0? Here's a more or less <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/6228">full run-down of Web 2.0</a>, and <a href="http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/161874_p.htm">five reasons why it matters</a>.

In the meantime, I'm still cranking away on my NLB'd terminal servers.

(And another <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2005/12/12/ruby-on-rails-revisited/">trackback test</a>).Â Â
