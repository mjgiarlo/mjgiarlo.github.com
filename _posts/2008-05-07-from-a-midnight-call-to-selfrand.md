I lament the greatest/crappiest dorkcore band (n)ever to have existed, Illegal Operation, with the stellar line-up of Major Crash on drums, General P. Fault on bass, and Colonel Dump on guitar.

It is rumored that there is some intersection between Illegal Operation, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lackoftalent" target="_blank">Lack of Talent</a>, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sausagebot" target="_blank">Sausagebot</a>.

P.S. Yes, I was (am) the (un-)esteemed Col. Dump.
P.P.S. I am woefully sleep-deprived this week.
