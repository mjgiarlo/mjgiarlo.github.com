Matt Zumwalt of <a href="http://yourmediashelf.com/" target="_blank">MediaShelf, LLC</a> has been hard at work thinking about how to make <a href="http://fedora.info/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>.  There is now a <a href="http://www.fedora.info/wiki/index.php/RESTful_Fedora_Proposal" target="_blank">proposal on the Fedora wiki</a> based on a PDF he sent to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=fedora-commons-developers" target="_blank">fedora-commons-developers list</a>.

It's an interesting proposal.  I've read over the PDF version quickly but it does bear a closer read.

Whether SOAP or REST is more appropriate for a Fedora API is something I'm not sure about, though I don't mean to imply it's an either/or situation.
