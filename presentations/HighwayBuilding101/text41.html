<ul><li><h2>Additional Considerations - the 3,000-pixel rule</h2>
<ul><li>Scanning at resolutions much higher than 600dpi may be required if the document is small in physical size.
<li>All digitized documents should be scanned such that each dimension of the visible area of the document (width, height) is comprised of a minimum of 3,000 pixels each.  If a scan at 600 dpi does not meet this minimum, then the resolution should be increased and the document re-scanned accordingly.  
<li>Extraneous image information (such as a calibration strip, record labels, or any part of the scanned image that does not directly pertain to the document itself) should not be included in this calculation.  
<li>Example: a 3”x5” color photograph scanned at 600 dpi will render an image that is 1800 x 3000 pixels.  As the width does not meet the minimum, a 600dpi scan will be unacceptable.  The scan should be increased to 1200 dpi to render a 3600 x 6000 pixel image, and thus bring the image to an acceptable level of detail.
