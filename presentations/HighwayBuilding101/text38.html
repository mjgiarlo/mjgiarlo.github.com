<ul><li><h2>Recognizing Digitization as a Preservation Reformatting Method - Prepared for the ARL Preservation of Research Library Materials Committee</h2>
<ul><li>Increases capture capability of items which have thus far been troublesome to preserve via traditional means
<li>Digital formats support a variety of novel behaviors unavailable or inconvenient in the print world such as magnification and dynamic repurposing
<li>Digitized materials can more closely approximate the “look and feel” of browsing a printed book, for instance, than can microform technologies
<li>Access!  Coupled with networking technologies, digitization provides the capability to serve users in-house and abroad, even in their own homes during off-hour periods
<li>May be the only way to preserve materials on other media
