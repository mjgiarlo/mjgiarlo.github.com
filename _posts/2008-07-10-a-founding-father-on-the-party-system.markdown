<blockquote>20 I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and <strong>warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party</strong>, generally.

21 This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.

22 <strong>The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.</strong> The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.

23 Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) <strong>the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</strong></blockquote>
George Washington, our first president, whom his peers wished to elevate to king, warns of the dangers of a party system in his <a href="http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/farewell/text.html" target="_blank">farewell address</a>.Â  It is widely known that Washington opposed the creation of parties -- and that he was the last president not to be affiliated with one -- but his words here are nonetheless powerful.

Seeing the stranglehold that the Democrats and Republicans have on power in the union makes me wonder if we haven't failed in this grand experiment by ignoring the wisdom of its founders and gradually abdicating our responsibility for its care, and our own liberty, like sheep who would ask wolves to babysit their lambs.
