<h1><font color=#333399> Mass Storage System</font></h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>For the New Jersey Digital Highway, we expect to digitize tens of terabytes of information over the next 3-5 years.  What sorts of storage solutions can be initially configured to hold 5-7TB and eventually scale to this size?</h2>
<ul><li>Direct-attached storage – the standard model of attaching new hard drives to a server gets messy when scalability is an issue, and becomes problematic if storage is to be shared among multiple servers
<li>Network-attached storage – NAS-based solutions scale more easily than do DAS-based ones, but due to NAS’s usage of the user network, performance / bandwidth could become a concern
<li>Removable media – as our repository is designed as both a preservation <i>and an access </i>platform, where digitized materials ought to be available 24 hours a day, removable media is not a viable solution
