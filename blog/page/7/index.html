  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading Adam Smith&#8217;s D-Lib <a href="http://dlib.org/dlib/september07/smith/09smith.html" target="_blank">article</a> has got me thinking about identifiers again.  I don&#8217;t agree with some of the assertions in the section titled &#8220;A Persistent Identifier Primer&#8221; &#8211; URIs <em>are</em> in fact persistent; we just break them through poor management &#8211; and so I&#8217;m led to a fundamental question: what are the good use cases for Handle (or ARK, or PURL) identifiers?</p>

<p>I get the need for persistent and globally unique identifiers; I&#8217;m just wondering why one needs special software with a separate URI namespace to gain persistence.</p>

<p>One potential use case might be resources that are outside of the organization&#8217;s control &#8211; i.e., licensed content from vendors &#8211; but surely folks are using Handles for many resources that are created and managed <em>within the organization</em>.  And I&#8217;m curious why they have decided that Handles are more durable than native URIs (the URIs to which Handles redirect), and how they deal with the problem of downstream (post-redirection) citation and bookmarking.  How useful is this sort of identifier scheme if your users never even see the supposedly more persistent URI for a resource?</p>

<p>As a former proponent of Handles and ARKs, this may seem like a hypocritical question to pose.  If I had to answer my own question, I would say that Handles seem like a good option because they save you some work and headaches in the short-term; you don&#8217;t need to get together with your web team and come up with a scalable and sustainable URI policy; just assign native URIs in the usual haphazard way and generate Handles to compensate for a lack of identifier policies.</p>

<p>But if you&#8217;re already making an organizational commitment to identifier persistence &#8211; and if you&#8217;re rolling out Handles, I&#8217;d wager that&#8217;s likely &#8211; why not do so by minting carefully-considered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URIs</a>?  Less management and technology overhead and less confusion for your users are two good reasons to consider it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Monday I woke up with a very mild and very annoying bronchial infection.  Doctor Me prescribed two days of rest, relaxation, and chicken soup.  Where &#8220;chicken soup&#8221; is &#8220;finally dropping the unreasonably expensive and embarrassingly outdated web hosting package at Speakeasy and transferring all of my domains and content to Dreamhost,&#8221; that is.  I am now paying less than a third of what I had been for a hell of a lot more features.  And, I must say, administering DNS records, transferring files, and upgrading long-neglected software is rather amusing when you&#8217;re loopy and feverish.</p>

<p>My experiences thus far with Dreamhost are very promising.  I&#8217;m impressed but perhaps that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been in the web hosting ghetto for so long.  I understand there will very likely be downtime and sluggishness &#8211; that I can deal with.  Being shackled to 1999 technologies for $30/mth, while my e-mails go unanswered, not so much.</p>

<p>I upgraded both Technosophia and my wife&#8217;s <a href="/elizabeth/" target="_blank">blog</a> to the latest WordPress release (2.3) from something ridiculous like 2.0.3.  In doing so, I also switched to the svn upgrade configuration Ryan Eby <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/easy-wordpress-upgrades-with-svn/" target="_blank">detailed</a> a while back.</p>

<p>I crossed my fingers and it turns out the <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/unapi-wordpress-plug-in/" target="_blank">unAPI server plug-in</a> still works in WP2.3.  Huzzah!  Not sure if it works in the 2.1 or 2.2 branches, but I suspect it does.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>October has been a month of transition for the past several years.</p>

<p>I moved into my first apartment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey" target="_blank">New Brunswick, NJ</a> (my hometown) in 2001, shortly after the attacks of 9/11.  2003 saw me preparing for the MLIS program at Rutgers.  Elizabeth and I moved from New Jersey to Seattle in 2005 so that I could study <a href="http://www.compling.washington.edu/" target="_blank">computational linguistics</a> at the University of Washington.  (I burned out on school very quickly and decided, after the <a href="http://code4lib.org/2006/" target="_blank">Code4Lib 2006 conference</a>, that I could in fact make a career in library technology.)  We moved back to the New Jersey area in 2006 for my current position working on the <a href="http://diglib.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">digital library</a> at Princeton.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a great year.  My time at Princeton has been highly rewarding and we&#8217;ve taken full advantage of living closer to our family and friends.</p>

<p>October is also my favorite month of the year (even when the Yankees <em>don&#8217;t</em> win the World Series): the leaves turn pretty colors; the air takes on that early autumn crispness; and groves of apples are ripe for the picking on lazy weekend afternoons.  And this October, we have yet more changes on the horizon.  Elizabeth and I are moving to <a href="http://www.commuterpage.com/art/villages/clarendon2.htm" target="_blank">Arlington, VA</a> and I&#8217;ll be starting at the Library of Congress on the 29th.  I&#8217;ll be working with folks like <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/" target="_blank">Dan</a> and <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/" target="_blank">Ed</a> on the repository development program, which supports a number of projects including <a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/" target="_blank">Chronicling America</a> (National Digital Newspaper Program).</p>

<p>It will be difficult to say goodbye to folks around here, but it&#8217;s the right move for us at this time.  Ah, October.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks for the nod, <a href="http://thedil.wordpress.com/2007/09/25/xquery-and-oai/" target="_blank">Winona</a>.  Hopefully you folks will get some good use out of the <a href="http://diglib2.princeton.edu/oss/wiki/xqOAI" target="_blank">XQuery-based OAI-PMH data provider</a> I&#8217;ve been working on.</p>

<p>I just want to clarify that only one small bit of the code is specific to X-Hive, and that&#8217;s a call to an extension that gets last-modified dates from the X-Hive service.  We do not reliably store this information in the metadata itself, and so I needed to go this route.  Some folks do store this in MODS or elsewhere in descriptive or administrative metadata.  It should be a two-line change to short-circuit this behavior (xhive-exts:last-update() is only invoked in two places, I believe).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently working on adding EAD support, modularizing things a bit more, and streamlining configuration.  resumptionTokens will come after that, I hope.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be interested to hear more of UVM&#8217;s implementation and how I can make this thing more useful to others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nicole Engard has posted the <a href="http://www.web2learning.net/archives/1212" target="_blank">results of her library school survey</a>.  She writes,</p>

<blockquote>Why arenâ€™t we all required to learn a bit of the basics from each area of the library? All schools should require an intro to reference/research, intro to cataloging, collection development, library automation, management, and systems class - that gives students a feel for each area of the library allowing them to decide where they want to go. Then after giving a grounding throw in some practical experience.</blockquote>


<p>I agree with her in principle that a core curriculum is helpful in preparing library school students for librarianship.  After all, what&#8217;s wrong with subjecting a future cataloger (or reference librarian, or subject selector, or systems librarian&#8230;) to learn about other aspects of what we do?  It puts their work in context within the library.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t speak authoritatively about other library schools, only having been to one, but I would surmise that the answer is simple: that the library degree tries to be too many things to too many people.  We need clearer vision.</p>

<p>Case in point: the MLIS degree at Rutgers combines library studies, information science, and school media studies.  If these disciplines are collapsed into the one degree, how is it possible to have a core curriculum?  A good strategy is to have multiple tracks with set requirements, but students are, for the most part, left to mix and match their courses.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the freedom afforded to students by this.  They can craft the degree that they want with very few restrictions.  And that works for some students.</p>

<p>One is left to wonder, though, what a library degree from, say, Rutgers says about a candidates&#8217; qualifications.  One conclusion to draw is that selection committees need to look beyond the degree towards specific courses and especially towards experience in the workplace, whether it be in a library or elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I proposed an <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/01/06/barcamp-for-nj-library-geeks/" target="_blank">NJ Library BarCamp</a> some months ago, not realizing that efforts were already under way to do the same in <a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">NYC</a>.  In retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t do anything to get things moving; I wouldn&#8217;t have pulled things together nearly as well as the NYC folks did.  The event was excellent.  It was my first camp, and I&#8217;d definitely try another.  A big thanks to <a href="http://www.teachinglibrarian.org/weblog/blogger.html" target="_blank">Stephen Francoeur</a> <em>et al.</em></p>

<p>Here are the three sessions I attended, with links to the &#8220;official&#8221; wiki pages for summaries:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/Solr+and+Lucene" target="_blank">Solr and Lucene</a> (session moderated by AIP&#8217;s Mark Matienzo and NYU&#8217;s Jason Casden) seem to be gaining momentum in the library world.  Having gone to the last Code4Lib conference, my head was already chock full of relevant tidbits, but the moderators did a great job of showing examples, evangelizing, and keeping the discussion going.</li>
    <li><a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/Grid+Services" target="_blank">Grid Services</a> (session moderated by OCLC Openly Informatics&#8217; Eric Hellman) might have been very interesting if I hadn&#8217;t kept receiving phone calls from an insurance company.  I had to take the calls, and so this session was difficult to follow.  The basic idea was to think of networked library services like the power grid.  What would libraries want from the grid?  What would they be willing to contribute back?</li>
    <li><a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/Semantic+Web" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a> (session moderated by NYU&#8217;s Corey Harper and CUNY&#8217;s Sunny Yoon) was the most widely attended session I went to: standing room only!  When I first added the topic to the wiki, I had no idea it would draw this many people.  Odd that I would suggest this topic since I had little to offer on the topic, so I gleaned an awful lot.  The discussion was spirited and, as you might expect, the RDF vs. microformats arguments flew fast and furious across the room.  I&#8217;m left wondering if the RDFa/GRRDL approach might not be a good middle-road between the &#8220;everything must be represented as RDF in a triplestore&#8221; camp and the &#8220;just embed microformats in xhtml&#8221; people.</li>
</ul>


<p>And now, the requisite name-dropping.  I got to reconnect with a bunch of people I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while, like Terry Catapano, <a href="http://bookism.org/open/" target="_blank">Jay Datema</a>, <a href="http://web2learning.net/" target="_blank">Nicole Engard</a>, <a href="http://theinfobabe.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Valerie Forrestal</a>, Kevin Reiss, and Sunny Yoon.  And I got to meet LibLime&#8217;s Chris Cormack, NYPL&#8217;s <a href="http://www.epistemographer.com/" target="_blank">Josh Greenberg</a>, Corey Harper, <a href="http://thesecretmirror.com/" target="_blank">Mark Matienzo</a>, Jenkins Law&#8217;s RayAna Min Park, and Steven&#8217;s Tech&#8217;s Linda Scanlon, among other people.</p>

<p>It was about as good as any camp without kayaks and archery can be.  Check out some <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/librarycampnyc2007" target="_blank">more summaries</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>1. Ruby</h2>


<p>I gave a little talk on Ruby at today&#8217;s <a href="http://meta.montclair.edu/tag.html" target="_blank">VALE-NJ Technology Awareness Group</a> meeting, and so I&#8217;m using my <a href="/michael/presentations/ruby-zen/" target="_blank">slides</a> to finally kick off this vaporseries.<br /><br /><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/michael/presentations/ruby-zen/Ruby-Zen.swf" width="600" height="400"><!--[if IE]><param name="movie" value="/michael/presentations/ruby-zen/Ruby-Zen.swf" />&lt; ![endif]&#8211;></object><small>[Slides are embedded as Flash here if you&#8217;re reading in an aggregator.]</small></p>

<p>It seemed to be taken pretty well, though it could easily have been dismissed as the fanboyish ravings of a neophyte Rubyist.  The folks from Rutgers were interested in having me come talk to their software architecture group, so it couldn&#8217;t have gone too badly, I suppose.</p>

<p>I need to stop cramming so much into presentations.  Rambling about reflection and OO at a speed the Micro-Machines Guy would envy isn&#8217;t the best way to share enthusiasm about Ruby.</p>

<p>The rest of the meeting was interesting: Ron Jantz, the Digital Library Architect at Rutgers, posed a number of challenging questions about trust, authenticity, and reliability in the digital realm; Terry Catapano, Special Collections Analyst at Columbia, exposed the lack of data model inherent in many current metadata schemas and suggested ontologies as a potential direction; and Jeffery Triggs, Applications Programmer at Rutgers, demonstrated the Java DjVu Viewer Applet for displaying DjVu-based images outside the DjVu browser plug-in.  Many good questions were asked, and new faces were in the crowd, so the future of TAG seems to be bright.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to follow up my Ruby talk with another on Rails.  That was my initial goal for today, but there was far too much to cover, knowing the audience was relatively new to both technologies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.librarywebchic.net/wordpress/2007/07/18/why-require-an-mls-for-library-technologists/" target="_blank">Karen Coombs</a> responds to <a href="http://dilettantes.code4lib.org/2007/07/09/union-card/" target="_blank">Ross Singer</a>, re: requiring an MLS degree in library technology positions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m torn on the issue, as an erstwhile systems analyst who went through library school primarily for letters after my name.  I&#8217;ve seen both sides of the divide and have seen IT positions that might have benefited from the MLS &#8211;  a particular non-MLS comes to mind who had no sense of which battles were winnable and ultimately wound up leaving &#8211; and also seen jobs with a totally unnecessary MLS requirement that accomplished little other than watering down the candidate pool.</p>

<p>If a position will need to interact with librarians or act in public services capacities, the MLS is very useful; folks from IT (or elsewhere in the extrabibliosphere) do not necessarily know our culture or our values &#8211; hell, they might not even speak our language.  And there is something to be said for this sort of familiarity.  Librarians hold the reins in libraries and if you can&#8217;t speak to their values in a language they understand, you are likely to spend much of your career tilting against windmills (and getting nowhere fast).</p>

<p>On the other hand, we librarian folk think that libraries are a hell of a lot more special than we actually are.  Our needs are sometimes esoteric, but many times they are not, and so an MLS requirement probably does more harm than good.  And too often &#8220;web librarian&#8221; and &#8220;systems librarian&#8221; are euphemisms for &#8220;underpaid IT workers.&#8221;  Earning a master&#8217;s degree should not <strong>reduce</strong> your earning potential, and yet that is precisely what happens.</p>

<p>In summary, I guess my views align with Karen&#8217;s  but I appreciate what Ross is adding to the dialogue (having experienced much of the same nonsense).  We need more Rosses in library-land, and ought to treat them very well in order to keep them around.  Library technologists are (read: &#8220;should be&#8221;) first-class citizens in libraries and will play an active if not vital role in our future, whether they have the MLS or not.  We&#8217;d do well to keep that in mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up this morning wanting to do something special, something patriotic.  Until I come up with something better, I&#8217;m blogging.  Yes, that might itself be a sad commentary, but there you go.</p>

<p>Amidst all the fireworks, barbecues, and (at times mechanical) flag-waving, I like to put the significance of today into perspective.  How do I do that?  I read the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>We have seen these words a million times before, but I read them closely trying to avoid the clichÃ©d meanings that soundbite culture has ascribed to them.  It helps to put the document into context; I think about the courage and vision of those who wrote these words.  I think about the thousands who embraced the upstart revolution and forsook the old order to take up arms against old allies.  I think about the millions who have sacrificed their lives and livelihood throughout the history of our nation, despite any feelings about the justifications and conditions of the wars and conflicts we have fought.  I think about the American Revolution which continues to this very day as we struggle against our own weaknesses and challenges from abroad to keep the dream alive.  This paragraph, perhaps more than any, encapsulates that dream:</p>

<blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8211;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, &#8211;That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&#8211;Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
</blockquote>


<p>It&#8217;s a powerful document and though it is not legally binding, it is the very spirit of our nation, this grand social experiment.  It is also a beautiful piece of prose and a landmark exposition of the principles of classical liberalism.  It&#8217;s as close to a Bible as I have, and I revere it.</p>

<p>Happy Independence Day, folks.  (And enjoy the fireworks, barbecues, and flag-waving.)</p>
