Oh frabjous day!  I noted with great excitement the following post from "Digital Eccentric," <a href="http://digitaleccentric.blogspot.com/2008/01/theatlanticcom.html" target="_blank">Leslie Johnston:</a>
<blockquote> I was initially very excited by the announcement on BoingBoing that <span style="font-style: italic">The Atlantic</span> had opened its archive.  I read the Editor's Note describing the decision.  I followed the link to start my exploration.

It's a little misleading. The _site_ is now open to all. They have "Unbound" (web only) content and full issues back to 1995 open. But their other free content seems to be selected material.</blockquote>
Back in 2000, after having survived the terrible and great Y2K (!@#), I read a fascinating article by Alston Chase on the childhood and college experiences of one Theodore "Ted" Kaczynski: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber" target="_blank">Unabomber</a>.  It humanizes him in a way that may have you screaming "darned bleeding-heart apologist, how dare you!" and puts his actions in a context where they actually, gulp, make some sense.  This is not to excuse his actions; rather, it is a glimpse into how an otherwise rational and normal (if brilliant) man transformed into a monster:
<blockquote> In the fall of 1958 Theodore Kaczynski, a brilliant but vulnerable boy of sixteen, entered Harvard College. There he encountered a prevailing intellectual atmosphere of anti-technological despair. There, also, he was deceived into subjecting himself to a series of purposely brutalizing psychological experiments -- experiments that may have confirmed his still-forming belief in the evil of science. Was the Unabomber born at Harvard?</blockquote>
