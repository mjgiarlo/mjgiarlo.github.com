<h1>Query Adaptation Techniques</h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>“In the course of a search session, a user creates and moves along a path of images.  In every iteration, the path changes and the query needs to be adapted accordingly.  The objects are treated as evidence of the user’s information need, with a changing degree of uncertainty associated to each object: the older the evidence, the more uncertain it is that it is still indicative of the <i>current</i> information need.  The degree of uncertainly is represented by the ostensive relevance profile.</h2>
<li><h2>The query is comprised of the weighted sum of evidence found in the path objects … collected from the documents’ features.”</h2>
