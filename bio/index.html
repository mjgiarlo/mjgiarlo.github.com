    I work at Penn State University as a digital library
    architect.  <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/mjg36/blogs/2010/01/whats-in-a-title.html">
    What does that mean?</a> I&#039;m designing a technical
    architecture for library and institutional data, providing vision
    and strategy for the development thereof, and building a
    development team to implement it, all of which are part of an
    institutional digital stewardship program formed by university
    libraries, central IT, and the university press.  Why?  As a
    colleague put it (tongue-in-cheek though it was, I&#039;m rather
    fond of it): we endeavor to &#034;build the worlds in which we
    remember.&#034;
  </p>
  <p>
    My last job was at the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of
    Congress</a>, on a team developing digital repository tools,
    processes, and architecture supporting initiatives such as
    the <a href="http://digitalpreservation.gov/">National Digital
    Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program</a>,
    the <a href="http://www.worlddigitallibrary.org/">World Digital
    Library,</a>
    and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/">Chronicling
    America</a> (the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/">National
    Digital Newspaper Program</a>).

    I earned an MLIS degree in 2006 from <a title="School of
    Communication and Information"
    href="http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/">School of Communication and
    Information</a> at <a title="The State University of New Jersey"
    href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers</a>, and enjoyed a brief
    stint in the Professional Master of Arts program
    in <a title="Professional MA in Computational Linguistics"
    href="http://www.compling.washington.edu/">Computational
    Linguistics</a> at the <a title="University of Washington"
    href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of
    Washington-Seattle</a>, where I was interested in applying
    techniques of natural language processing to metadata extraction
    from full-text digital collections.  My undergraduate degree, also
    from Rutgers, is in linguistics and philosophy, capped by an
    honors thesis on syntactic and semantic theories of pronouns and
    reflexives in Germanic languages. I joined Phi Beta Kappa only to
    discover it would not get me into any toga parties.

    Previously I developed tools for the Princeton
    University <a href="http://diglib.princeton.edu/">digital
    library</a>.  My projects
    included: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/noidman/wiki/Arkham">Arkham</a>
    &amp; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/noidman/wiki/Noidman">Noidman</a>,
    Ruby on Rails web applications for the creation, management,
    validation, and resolution of persistent identifiers based on
    the <a title="Archival Resource Key"
    href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/">ARK</a>
    schema; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xqoai/">xqOAI</a>, an
    XQuery-based <a title="Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for
    Metadata Harvesting"
    href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH</a>
    data provider for native XML databases; scripts for metadata
    munging; and hacking and
    managing <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>-based
    departmental wikis / code repositories / ticketing systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to that, I worked for the <a title="University of Washington
    Libraries" href="http://www.lib.washington.edu/">University of
    Washington Libraries</a> (2005-6) and
    the <a href="http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University
    Libraries</a> (1999-2005) as a systems administrator, project
    coordinator, and digital library/repository hacker, and before
    that wore a bunch of hats for a small Internet service provider
    during the mid-late &#039;90s dot-com boom. As an undergrad, a
    work-study program placed me in
    the <a href="http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/libs/alex_lib/alex_lib.shtml">Archibald
    S. Alexander Library</a> at Rutgers, where my love for libraries
    was kindled.
