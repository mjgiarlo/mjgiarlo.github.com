  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve posted a couple <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/persistent-url-bookmarker/" target="_blank">new tools</a> during the past couple days.  One is an update of <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/staff/smith.htm" target="_blank">Devon Smith</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://purl.org/net/linkpurl" target="_blank">LinkPURL</a> extension for Firefox 2.0.</p>

<p>The other is an ultra-lightweight Wordpress plugin that embeds a linkpurl link tag for auto-discovery (so bookmarking agents can detect and grab the persistent URL rather than the impersistent URL up in the addressbar).</p>

<p>Based on a discussion in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/code4lib" target="_blank">#code4lib</a> earlier today, I realize that there are a lot of important questions, not to mention serious doubts, about persistent identifiers.  I flip-flop on their utility myself, so I found the discussion very useful.  (Thanks, <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/" target="_blank">edsu</a>!)  Maybe I&#8217;ll write a post or two about persistent identifiers to flesh my thoughts out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had to create some Trac reports a while back, and figured I would share them with the world wide (time)waste.</p>

<p>The first selects all completed milestones:</p>

<pre>SELECT name,
    date(completed, 'unixepoch') as Completed,
    date(due, 'unixepoch') as Due,
    description
FROM milestone
WHERE completed > 1
ORDER BY completed DESC</pre>


<p>And the second lists all of your closed tickets:</p>

<pre>SELECT p.value AS __color__,
    (CASE status
        WHEN 'closed' THEN 'color: #777; background: #ddd; border-color: #ccc;'
        ELSE
            (CASE owner WHEN '$USER' THEN 'font-weight: bold' END)
    END) AS __style__,
    id AS ticket, summary, component, version, milestone,
    t.type AS type, severity, priority, time AS created,
    changetime AS _changetime, description AS _description,
    reporter AS _reporter
FROM ticket t, enum p
WHERE status IN ('closed') AND p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority' AND owner = '$USER'
ORDER BY (status = 'assigned') DESC, p.value, milestone, severity, time</pre>


<p>They were pretty easy to whip up based on the other reports, but I figured I might save someone else a few minutes by sharing.  For all that I&#8217;ve <strike>plagiarized</strike> borrowed from the web, it&#8217;s time to pay that karma down a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The &#8221;<a href="http://liszen.com/index.html?cx=007111056751095715160%3A3qdthmlca-m&q=five+things&cof=FORID%3A9" target="_blank">five things</a>&#8221; virus has been going around a bunch during the past month or two.Â  While I wasn&#8217;t specifically tagged by anyone, I&#8217;m foisting my own five things upon the biblioblogosphere (and, oh,Â how I loathe that word).Â  I&#8217;m not aÂ terribly interesting person, so it was a struggle to come up with five things.Â  I tend not to share muchÂ personal information here, but I&#8217;d like to break that habit for now, since this approach is at loggerheads with my relatively open-bookish nature.Â  Disclaimers aside, <em>voici</em>!</p>

<ol>
    <li>After finishing up my bachelor&#8217;s degree, and feeling oh-so-special for being aÂ <a href="http://hrthesis.rutgers.edu/pastschol/1998.htm" target="_blank">Henry Rutgers Scholar</a>Â and a fairly successful <strike>slacker</strike> student, I moved to rural Oregon and spent the next nine months living in a barn.Â  (I&#8217;d realized that a degree in linguistics and philosophy was less than marketable.)Â  It marked the first time I lived beyond the boundaries of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey" target="_blank">New Brunswick, NJ</a>, and sparked my love affair with the Pacific Northwest.Â  After living in &#8220;the barn,&#8221; which towards the end of my stay became infested with some very nasty insects &#8211; more details for those who inquire within &#8211; I moved back to New Brunswick for seven years, and then wound up heading back to Seattle for a year.Â  And now I&#8217;m back east, yet again, living in Bucks Cty., PA.</li>
    <li>IÂ was diagnosed with anterior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopituitarism" target="_blank">hypopituitarism</a> as a child, which incidentally is the same conditionÂ Gary Coleman has.Â  Yes, Gary &#8220;whaddyoo talkin&#8217; &#8216;bout, Willis?&#8221; Coleman.Â  I was fortunate to have a very good pediatrician who surmised very early on that my short stature might be due to such a condition, and I started taking growth hormone (and various other hormones) aroundÂ 1st grade.Â  While I&#8217;m still a bit on the short side, I would never have grown an inch above four feet tall had I not been treated.Â  Treatment involves a daily injection of growth hormone, which I still take as an adult.Â  The doctors aren&#8217;t sure why I have this condition, but my father&#8217;s best guess is that it&#8217;s due to Agent Orange poisoning &#8211; he served two tours as an infantryman and helicopter gunner in Vietnam.</li>
    <li>I am somewhat at risk for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease" target="_blank">Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</a>, having been treated for a few years with growth hormone that was harvested from cadaver brains, rather than synthesized which it has been since 1985 or so.Â  So far, only folks who were treated before 1978 have come down with CJD, but it can take upwards of 35 years before symptoms develop.Â  Or so says the <a href="http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/creutz/creutz.htm" target="_blank">Department of HHS report</a>.Â  I&#8217;m probably safe, but it&#8217;s something my wife and I will have to keep an eye on for a while yet.</li>
    <li>I met my wife on <a href="http://meetme.hotornot.com/" target="_blank">Hot or Not</a>.Â  (I&#8217;m pretty sure I was the &#8220;Not.&#8221;)Â  I paid $6 to be able to e-mail her, and it was the best $6 I ever spent.</li>
    <li>I used to be aÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larp" target="_blank">LARP</a>er.Â  If you&#8217;re curious &#8211;Â and who wouldn&#8217;t be? &#8211;Â my characters were a barbarian fighter, a highlander ranger, an elven wizard, and an ascetic monk.Â  Yes, I have the costumes to prove it.Â  No, I won&#8217;t show you pictures.Â  (Unless you piss me off.)</li>

<p>Aren&#8217;t you glad you read along?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just noticed <a target="_blank" href="http://inkdroid.org">Ed Summers</a> posted a link to <a target="_blank" href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampDC1">DemoCampDC1</a>, a local <a target="_blank" href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a> being organized in the Washington D.C. area, &#8220;to build an active community for people in the DC area to show up and informally share geeky stuff.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve heard of these BarCamps before, but I never really took the time to look into it.  Incidentally, I&#8217;ve been looking for good models for hosting and organizing such a group for a while now, inspired by the work Brian Hancock has done over the years with the <a target="_blank" href="http://meta.montclair.edu/tag.html">Technology Awareness Group</a> (TAG).  The way the D.C. group is going about it looks like a promising one: start out building a community with very informal meetings outside of work hours, to test the waters, so to speak, and build a rapport with interested parties.  And if there&#8217;s sufficient interest, hold a full BarCamp event (perhaps a one-day hands-on symposium / workshop).</p>

<p>I like this model quite a bit, and I&#8217;d be interested in trying to get something similar started up in New Jersey.  We have tons of talented library geeks in our many academic, public, and special libraries, not to mention general geeks whose interests and skill sets intersect with ours.</p>

<p>Why BarCamp?  Don&#8217;t we have enough meetings and symposiums?  Sure, we&#8217;re all spread thin.  Our niche would be to bring together the TAG-style dog &amp; pony shows with code sprints and other collaborative development <em>a la</em> the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/?page_id=13">Access Hackfest</a>.  We&#8217;re looking for a group that will be innovative, collegial, social, practical, and - not to be corny, but - fun-loving.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I envision:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A number of very informal get-togethers spread throughout the state in order to foster inclusivity, with a &#8220;point person&#8221; in each area to report back about the level of interest</li>
    <li>Rotating event venues, possibly one per &#8220;point person&#8221; above who would ideally receive institutional support in one form or another</li>
    <li>Partnerships with other in-state groups to take advantage of cross-pollination without crossing purposes, such as TAG, NJLA&#8217;s IT section, NJ-ASIS&T, and some student groups from Rutgers SCILS</li>
</ul>


<p>Any of you New Jerseyans interested?  Think it&#8217;s a waste of time?  Drop a comment or trackback here, or send me e-mail.  I&#8217;m very interested in your feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to updating the unAPI plugin for WordPress so that it fits into the WordPress plugin architecture, making it simple to install and maintain. I&#8217;m calling it version 1.0 since it&#8217;s the first substantial release of the plugin since I got involved.  Just unzip that sucker (or check the code out) to wp-content/plugins/unapi and do the rest via the administration pages, including activation and identifier configuration.</p>

<p>I updated the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/unapi-wordpress-plug-in/">plugin page</a> and imported it into the <a target="_blank" href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/unapi/trunk/">svn repo</a> hosted at wp-plugins.org.</p>

<p>This was my first WP plugin, so I would appreciate any feedback.  All you folks that are using it should try stripping out the old version (which requires hacking some theme files) and plugging this in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was pleased to see the note that Sandy Payette sent to the fedora-users mailing list earlier today, updating the community on the <a target="_blank" href="http://comm.nsdl.org/pipermail/fedora-users/2006-December/002330.html">Fedora 2.2 release date</a>.  Version 2.2 is going to include a bunch of features, some of which have been long-awaited and are quite, well, sexy.  Some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Database support has been extended to include Postgres, which should make all the MySQL-haters happy</li>
    <li>Fedora may now be deployed via a .war file in an existing servlet container, such as Tomcat, rather than requiring its very own Tomcat server</li>
    <li>A Lucene- or Zebra-backed search service has been included, which is more robust than the previous search service that used the built-in Dublin Core-populated database</li>
</ul>


<p>These are but a few of the enhancements, and I can&#8217;t wait to put it through its paces when it&#8217;s released on January 19th.</p>

<p>For a more complete set of feature enhancements, click on the link above to read Sandy&#8217;s message.</p>

<p>Now if we can come together as a community and work on some more UIs, and get them used in some high-profile projects, many of the gripes against Fedora may be silenced.  It&#8217;s still not a perfect product, but what is?   That it uses XML as a storage format and exposes its functions via web-services APIs and allows use of any metadata schema, in my humble opinion, puts it <strong>head and shoulders above</strong> many other library repository solutions.  And for that, it&#8217;s at least worth consideration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The magnanimous folks who are planning the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.njla.org/conference/2007/">2007 NJLA conference</a> have invited little ol&#8217; me to give a presentation on unAPI in April.  I&#8217;m excited about the opportunity to evangelize about all of the interesting work and ideas out there in LibraryLand and beyond, and I have subsequently, and humbly, requested to expand the scope of my talk.  Fortunately, they have agreed, and I&#8217;m sharing the title and abstract here to gather impressions.</p>

<p>Thanks especially to <a target="_blank" href="http://meta.montclair.edu/">Brian Hancock</a> for encouraging me to present at <a target="_blank" href="http://meta.montclair.edu/tag.html">TAG</a> two months ago, to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/25776870">Mary Mallery</a> for the invitation, and to <a target="_blank" href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">Dan Chudnov</a> for inspiring the lion&#8217;s share of the ideas I intend to ramble about.</p>

<blockquote><u>A library revolution: </u><u>Returning the means of production via service discovery, systems integration, and open standards</u>

Imagine, if you will, a world where library services are automatically discovered; Library users retrieve information objects and metadata with a single click, never having to navigate the dark alleys of dead-ends that are full-text resolvers; Information sources and services are connected and remixed according to user preferences and needs, where and when they wish. What if we could leverage existing library and industry standards, applications, and protocols to make this a  reality?  And soon?

Technologies such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.niso.org/standards/standard_detail.cfm?std_id=783">OpenURL</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://unapi.info/">unAPI</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dns-sd.org/">DNS-SD</a> are explained and their promise is examined in this context, alongside ideas such as service registries, auto-discovery, and integration of search and resolve systems.  Such evolutionary steps paired with bold, forward-thinking direction and a commitment to innovation may indeed lead us to this &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; scenario.</blockquote>
