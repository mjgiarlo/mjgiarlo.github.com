Forget about that Instant Rails stuff. Try the following tutorial instead, which gave me a better sense of how Rails actually works. Very, very helpful.

Ruby on Rails is quite cool. What I don't like about it, so far:
<ol>
	<li>I don't know Ruby, so I can't do anything sophisticated with Rails</li>
	<li>I'm not sure how much I like the idea of all Rails applications being so intimately tied to the Rails framework.</li>
</ol>
