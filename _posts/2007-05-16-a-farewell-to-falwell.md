I decided a while back that I would use this space exclusively for library- and technology-related bits, that I should not clutter it with more personal or political matters.  That decision has probably saved me a lot of embarrassment.  But it's also kept me from updating more often than I would like, and forced filters upon me that give a one-dimensional view of what I'm about.  Underlying the decision was a certain trepidation and strange sense of professional propriety -- what would colleagues and potential employers think of me if I just spilled my guts out here?

I'm starting to question that decision.  Other well-known biblio-bloggers do it -- I'm looking at <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/" target="_blank">Dorothea</a> and <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/" target="_blank">Karen</a> -- though I'm in the league below the bush league compared to them. But sometimes, dammit, I just want to be me.

I'd like to add to the left-leaning echo chamber by reminding folks that Jerry Falwell was a lunatic.  People come out of the woodwork to spout ebullient praise about the recently deceased, whether they were actually good people or not, and the posthumous Falwell spin has begun with numerous smiley glad-hands lauding his life and deeds.  But let's not forget what kind of guy ol' Jerry was.  <blockquote><b>I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped [the terrorist attacks on 9/11] happen'.</b></blockquote>

I'm not so crass as to celebrate the death of someone who has arguably done some good during his long lifetime, but I couldn't help but think "good riddance to bad rubbish" when I heard of his passing.

I am sure there will be dozens of doomsayers scrambling to take his place in the Pantheon of Evangelical Kooks.  I can see it now: <i>And lo, I woke up this morning and my toilet was running.  SURELY THIS IS A SIGN OF THE SECOND COMING.</i>
