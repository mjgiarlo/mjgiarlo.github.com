<ul><li><h2>In the OM, relevance feedback is provided implicitly “by interpreting a user’s selection of one document over others as an indication that this document is more relevant.”</h2>
<li><h2>The query submitted to the system is learned and continues to be adapted based on the features of the images to which the user browses</h2>
<li><h2>Ostensive Relevance is thus defined: “The Ostensive Relevance of an information object is the degree to which evidence from the object is representative / indicative of the current information need</h2>
