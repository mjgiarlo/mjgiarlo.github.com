    <div class="entry"><p>I followed a series of links[<a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/03/12/will-libraries-smell-like-teen-spirit/#note1">1</a>] to find this <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=b1f851b9-b5ff-41bb-bf17-4aadba0ac89e" target="_blank">article</a> on the effect of Generation X values upon work culture.  The article cites the impending wave of Baby Boomer retirements, pointing out that a number of executive and upper management positions will open up and likely be filled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X">Generation Xers</a>.  Will workplace culture change when GenXers take the reins?  If so, to what extent?  And how will it affect libraries which, unlike the corporate world, are saturnine[<a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/03/12/will-libraries-smell-like-teen-spirit/#note2">2</a>]?</p>

<p>If organizational culture is in part derived from the values and culture of those who are at the helm, it is bound to change when Generation X takes over.  Baby Boomers are described as follows:<blockquote>&#8220;Leadership for them has been characterized by workaholic tendencies and materialism. Baby Boomers have had a minimum number of careers or a single career path, are impressed by authority, are optimistic and are driven to achieve.&#8221;</blockquote>GenXers, on the other hand,<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;question authority, seek bigger meaning in life and work, are technologically savvy, live in the present, are skeptical, see career as a key to happiness, are open to multi-careers, consider challenge and variety as being more important than job security and constantly aim to achieve work-life balance.&#8221;</blockquote>An obvious criticism of the differences between the generations is that they are only generalizations and that they apply only to those who fit the stereotypes.  However, it does seem naÃ¯ve to assume that none of the generalizations apply, that cultures and skill sets do not vary generationally; stereotypes are rooted in the truth.</p>

<p>The article links to a study showing that<blockquote>&#8220;Baby Boomers received higher ratings from managers in 10 out of 18 competencies, particularly in their ability to coach and develop people and to manage execution. Generation X managers received higher ratings in self-development, work commitment and analyzing issues&#8221;</blockquote>GenXers will need to work on their ability to mentor and on expanding upon their analysis skills with the ability to synthesize as well; it is important to see both the forest <strong>and</strong> the trees.  Whereas Baby Boomers are more comfortable in standard hierarchies, GenXers take more of a team-building approach, valuing independence and creativity to get the job done, whatever it may be.  GenXers are also reported to thrive on change which is a key attribute in dealing successfully with disruptive technologies and technological discontinuities, clearly an area where improvement is needed.</p>

<p>As a GenXer, I am cynical about the likelihood of my generation&#8217;s general disdain for bureacratic structure having any noticeable effect upon the bureaucracy, so common in academia, that seems to cripple decision-making processes and any semblance of agility.  I would love to see a new crop of administrators and managers come in and abolish the old ways of &#8220;analysis paralysis.&#8221;  Why not take a heuristic-based approach to management?   Instead of discussing something <em>ad nauseum</em> in three months&#8217; worth of meetings, why not try it out as a pilot project?</p>

<p>Still, I am hopeful.  If the coming wave of retirements brings in a batch of administrators that value agility, tear down process-tangling walls of bureaucracy, encourage and reward creativity, embrace innovation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_works">skunk-works</a> as being essential to our mission, and generally stir the pot in some productive fashion, the future holds great things.</p>

<p>Besides, I can&#8217;t wait for flannel shirts and wool hats to become <em>de rigueur</em> for Academic Library Fashion 2.0.  (Or will the meme have evolved to 3.0 by that time?)</p>

<p><a name="note1">1.</a> I&#8217;ve been following Mark Leggott&#8217;s <a href="http://loomware.typepad.com/slowlibrary/" target="_blank">Slow Library blog</a> the past few months.  Read the <a href="http://loomware.typepad.com/slowlibrary/2007/02/ahhhthe_beauty_.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Ahhh&#8230;the Beauty of Slow&#8221; post</a> for an explanation of what the movement entails.  The latest post contains a link to the <a href="http://www.slowleadership.org/" target="_blank">Slow Leadership blog</a>, which is where I found the Generation X article.</p>

<p><a name="note2">2.</a> This is a base generalization; I admit that libraries might even be more agile than the corporate world in some areas, but do tend to believe that we are slow-moving, change-resistant beasts in general.</p>
