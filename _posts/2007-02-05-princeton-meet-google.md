Google and Princeton University went public twenty minutes ago in announcing their arrangement to digitize roughly one million of Princeton's public domain works as part of the ongoing Google Books initiative.  Princeton is one of a growing number of academic institutions in the United States -- including private institutions like Harvard and Stanford and state universities in Virginia, Texas, and California -- that have worked with Google on this.  For more information, see the <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/02/welcoming-princeton-university-to.html" target="_blank">post</a> on the Google Books blog or the official <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/books_princeton.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>.

Many of the details need to be worked out yet, but I am hopeful this will bode well for our users here at Princeton and for the broader community.

The need for digital preservation just grows and grows.
