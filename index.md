Mike Giarlo is a senior software engineer and architect at Stanford University Libraries&mdash;working remotely from Seattle, Washington&mdash;where he works on a team tasked with designing and developing software for long-term access to the University's research and cultural assets. His focus is on the development and maintenance of Stanford's digital library, especially the Stanford Digital Repository, where he works extensively with open source software and communities.

He has been working in information technology in academic and research libraries since 1999, holding software development positions primarily in support of digital libraries and repositories at Penn State University, the Library of Congress, Princeton University, the University of Washington, and Rutgers University. He earned both a bachelor's degree in linguistics and a master's degree in library and information science at Rutgers University, in his hometown of New Brunswick, New Jersey.

In a Venn diagram of three-letter initialisms, he exists roughly at the intersection of APIs, AIPs, and IPAs.
