Since my staff.washington.edu account will soon go away, I'veÂ movedÂ the site to my personal domain for the time being.Â  If you have bookmarked the old hard-coded URLs, you'll need to change your bookmarks.Â  The persistent URL for Technosophia is <a href="http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog">http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog</a>, and the feed link is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia">http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia</a>.Â 

It's likely that I've missed some links and broken some others.Â  If you notice any problems, drop me a line.Â  Hopefully this shift will not affect my small andÂ strange audience.
