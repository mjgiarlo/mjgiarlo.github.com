I don't ordinarily post pictures around here but I am making an exception.Â  Elizabeth and I recently spent a week in Anchorage, AK, where my in-laws were gathered for a family reunion.Â  Eliz took a bunch of pictures and has uploaded a few to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/geek_patrol/sets/72157606898511203/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.

Boy, but it is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/geek_patrol/2787616673/sizes/l/in/set-72157606898511203/" target="_blank">gorgeous</a> up there.Â  A fellow sure could get used to all those <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/geek_patrol/2788465898/sizes/l/in/set-72157606898511203/" target="_blank">mountain vistas</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/geek_patrol/2788467506/sizes/l/in/set-72157606898511203/" target="_blank">free-range zucchinis</a> (?!).
