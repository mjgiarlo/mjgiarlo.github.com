In my last [braindump](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200049/http://www.personal.psu.edu/mjg36/blogs/2010/04/braindump-for-q2-2010.html), I wrote:

> The I2 working group is putting finishing touches on a draft standard and on core metadata required to identify institutions.  We hope to share this draft and put out a request for comments in the coming months.  I've been modeling the I2 domain in RDF both for more RDF experience and also with the hope that an eventual I2 core service will be exposed as [linked data](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200049/http://linkeddata.org/).

I've now documented this experience on [my other blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200049/http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2010/05/19/i2-resource-description/), which is the home of my [I2 ramblings](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200049/http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/projects/niso-i2/).
