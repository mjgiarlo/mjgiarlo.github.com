<ul><li><h2>What system of term weighting will be able to distinguish content value the most effectively?</h2>
<ul><li>Term frequency (<b>tf</b>)<b>–</b> A measure of the frequency with which a term appears in a document or query.
<li>Inverse document frequency (<b>idf</b>)<b>–</b> A collection-dependent measure that varies inversely with the number of documents to which a term is assigned.
<li>Term discrimination – Term frequency multiplied by inverse document frequency, or <b>tf x idf</b>.
<li>Normalization factor – A formula which normalizes the term-weighting so that shorter documents, with potentially fewer document descriptors, are not more difficult to find than longer documents, with potentially more descriptors.
