<a href="/michael/blog/json-in-firefox">JSONovich</a> is now in the "sandbox" over at addons.mozilla.org, where it will remain until it's been tested a bit more, and rated and reviewed by users.  Until that point, it will be marked as "experimental" and will require users to login before they can download it.  If any of you would like to give JSONovich a quick spin and rate/review it over at the Mozilla add-ons site, that would be solid.  Once it's gotten a few reviews and I'm more comfortable about it working cross-platform and cross-version, I'll nominate it to be promoted.

Here's where it lives: <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10122" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10122</a>

Much obliged, folks.  And thanks to those of you who have already downloaded it, installed it, tested it, left comments, or some combination thereof.
