  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe but I&#8217;ve been at the <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/09/27/october/" target="_blank">new job</a> for six months already, a full half-year come the 29th.  Some days it seems like I&#8217;ve been here forever; others like I&#8217;m still a rank newb.   I haven&#8217;t written terribly much about what I&#8217;ve been up to (but I assure you I&#8217;ve been busy).  Let me rectify that.</p>

<h2><strong>The Transfer Problem</strong></h2>


<p>Two of the projects I&#8217;ve been working on relate to a fairly general problem that we like to call &#8220;transfer,&#8221; which revolves around, well, transferring files to and fro.  Sounds simple.  <em>Is</em> simple.  That is, until you start thinking about preservation and accounting for a highly heterogeneous network with idiosyncratic nodes, esoteric storage software, and differential firewall rules.  And that&#8217;s where it gets interesting (and problematic). </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; meanwhile, the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/" target="_blank">Code4Lib Journal</a> has published its <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issue2" target="_blank">second issue</a> and boy is it packed with articles; <a href="http://www.library.nd.edu/daiad/morgan/" target="_blank">Eric Lease Morgan</a>, Coordinating Editor of the issue, does a bang-up job on the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/71" target="_blank">introduction</a> (though the title has effectively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Than_a_Feeling" target="_blank">Bostonroll</a>&#8216;d me).</p>

<blockquote>Each article in this issue has a little bit of something for all who call themselves a librarian or work in a library. Each identifies some sort of library problem to be addressed, and offers one or more solutions. Many are complete with code snippets. After all, this is Code4Lib.

For example, people in public service may be interested in Edward M. Corrado and Kathryn A. Frederickâ€™s review of database-driven <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/47">subject guide applications</a>. Kenneth Furuta and Michele Potter describe a simple <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/45">help system</a> that brings librarians running to the reference desk. Margaret Mellinger and Kim Griggs explain how library resources can be organized into <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/63">course pages</a> without the need of HTML knowledge and yet sport Web 2.0 features. Nancy Fried Foster, Nora Dimmock, and Alison Bersani shed light on <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/53">participatory design</a>.

For those of us who enjoy cataloging and metadata issues, Jonathan Gorman outlines how he modified VUFind to exploit Wikipedia and cataloging <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/57">authority records</a> to enhance information about authors in a library catalog. Chris Freeland, Martin Kalfatovic, Jay Paige, and Marc Crozier illustrate a different use of <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/52">Library of Congress Subject Headings</a> by integrating place names with Google Maps. Carol Jean Godby, Devon Smith and Eric Childress describe a technique for <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/54">crosswalking</a> just about any metadata format into just about any other metadata format.

For the systems librarian in you, Dan Scott and Kevin Beswick share how they used Linux live CDs customized as kiosk browsers to provide laptops as <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/49">â€˜quick lookupâ€™ stations</a> at their library. Andrew Darby takes advantage of the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/46">Google Calendar API</a> to easily manage the display of library hours. Jody DeRidder exploits Google <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/43">sitemap technology</a> and static HTML pages to make content in the â€œdeep Webâ€ more accessible. We hope you find these articles useful, stimulating, and relevant to your daily working lives.</blockquote>


<p>I  am ashamed to admit that I have not yet finished the <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issue1" target="_blank">first issue</a>, so I now have pages upon pages to read.  Ordinarily when I am behind on my reading I wind up letting bits fall by the wayside but the material largely looks too good to ignore.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Editorial Committees past and present and to the <a href="http://code4lib.org/" target="_blank">community</a> on the whole!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That I very nearly called this post &#8220;Southern comfort&#8221; reveals me as a long-time yankee from the urban northeast.Â  No, I suppose Arlington, Virginia isn&#8217;t quite the south &#8211; certainly not culturally &#8211; but you can see why I&#8217;d say so if you consider that I once thought any place south of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_195_(New_Jersey)" title="Interstate 195 (New Jersey)" target="_blank">195</a> may as well have been Deliverance country.Â  Ah, the old provincialisms.Â   And to further deconstruct this ridiculous metaphor, my entire apartment is probably smaller than a veranda.</p>

<p>But, boy howdy, did I have a relaxing and refreshing day: sitting on the couch with the windows open, reviewing a chapter of a friend&#8217;s upcoming book, while the wind rustled the blooming saucer magnolia right outside the windows.Â  It was a beautiful, sunny day, and the pair of mourning doves that have taken up residence on the neighbor&#8217;s window sill were soaking up the rays, singing their &#8220;woo-woo-oo-oo-oo&#8221; song on occasion.</p>

<p>Almost any sort of writing is a real chore for me and yet every now and then I commit to writing or editing something or other.Â  I enjoy it but it does take the sort of concentration that I&#8217;ve found so difficult of late.Â Â  I do not regret agreeing to review the chapter in question (on DRM technologies, for the curious), and I feel somewhat validated in my decision after the elements all aligned today and made for a very pleasant time.Â  (I did not get as much done as I would have liked, but what else is new?Â  Time management remains a challenging task, especially when the television and the internets are so near. )</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to ramble and I don&#8217;t really have a point.Â  It was a good day &#8211; an entire good weekend in fact &#8211; and I felt it worth committing to bits.</p>

<p>&#8230; Hey, are those banjos I hear?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>THESE are the times that try men&#8217;s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. &#8211; Thomas Payne, <u>The American Crisis</u></blockquote>


<p>Rest in peace, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23472461/" target="_blank">GOP</a>.  You had a good run, but in the end, loyalty to a broken system weighed down the time-tested principles of the party that Lincoln built.  Now you are grand only in name.</p>

<p>I remain hopeful that the enthusiasm of the Ron Paul Revolutionaries sustains their efforts to transform the Republican party, from the ground up, back to the party of non-interventionism and small government (even while my own energy to stay involved has waned).  I do believe there is a place for (small l) libertarian ideals in American political debate and that place is not out along the fringe.  And though I am a lifelong progressive, I will continue to play whatever small part I might in nudging the GOP away from neo-conservatism, which I see as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-fascism" target="_blank">highly dangerous ideology</a>.</p>

<p>It is looking more and more likely that I will have no better option than to vote for Barack Obama (EDIT: or Hillary since she did not bomb in last night&#8217;s primaries) in the 2008 election.   The Democrats are no less the party of American Empire than the Republicans and I am troubled that the only two viable options in our electoral system  are <em>both</em> agents of big government and imperialism.  I have long supported the Democratic party despite their being a ship of fools, more concerned with the fringe than with the core, despite rampant political correctness, despite turning their backs on the anti-federalist principles upon which they were founded.  I won&#8217;t feel at home among their ranks, but I will very likely be supporting their candidate against the war-mongering John McCain.</p>

<p>Cynicism and idealism are battling within me, and I fear it&#8217;s only a matter of time before cynicism once again wins the day.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;m being dramatic.  Maybe I&#8217;m overreacting a bit.  But damn it, am I bummed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh frabjous day!  I noted with great excitement the following post from &#8220;Digital Eccentric,&#8221; <a href="http://digitaleccentric.blogspot.com/2008/01/theatlanticcom.html" target="_blank">Leslie Johnston:</a></p>

<blockquote> I was initially very excited by the announcement on BoingBoing that <span style="font-style: italic">The Atlantic</span> had opened its archive.  I read the Editor&#8217;s Note describing the decision.  I followed the link to start my exploration.

It&#8217;s a little misleading. The _site_ is now open to all. They have &#8220;Unbound&#8221; (web only) content and full issues back to 1995 open. But their other free content seems to be selected material.</blockquote>


<p>Back in 2000, after having survived the terrible and great Y2K (!@#), I read a fascinating article by Alston Chase on the childhood and college experiences of one Theodore &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kaczynski: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unabomber" target="_blank">Unabomber</a>.  It humanizes him in a way that may have you screaming &#8220;darned bleeding-heart apologist, how dare you!&#8221; and puts his actions in a context where they actually, gulp, make some sense.  This is not to excuse his actions; rather, it is a glimpse into how an otherwise rational and normal (if brilliant) man transformed into a monster:</p>

<blockquote> In the fall of 1958 Theodore Kaczynski, a brilliant but vulnerable boy of sixteen, entered Harvard College. There he encountered a prevailing intellectual atmosphere of anti-technological despair. There, also, he was deceived into subjecting himself to a series of purposely brutalizing psychological experiments &#8211; experiments that may have confirmed his still-forming belief in the evil of science. Was the Unabomber born at Harvard?</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is very rough, but here&#8217;s a WordPress plugin that provides a <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/wp-content/plugins/oai-ore/rem.php" target="_blank">resource map</a> for the aggregation of all posts within an installation of WordPress.  I&#8217;ll be working on this some more, but for now, it does appear to work and validate (as Atom).  Useful?  If so, I&#8217;ll zip it up and commit it to the wp-plugins svn.</p>

<p>Note:<a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/" target="_blank">Ed</a> reminds me that xsltproc can be used to transform the Atom-based resource map into RDF via GRDDL:</p>

<p><code>xsltproc http://www.openarchives.org/ore/atom-grddl.xsl http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/wp-content/plugins/oai-ore/rem.php</code></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Moving Day has come.  In approximately six-and-one-half hours, movers will show up at my front door to take my crap &#8211; which seems to have multiplied, making me wonder if dark closets are particularly romantic environments for inanimate objects &#8211; and haul it down to <a href="http://www.commuterpage.com/ART/villages/clarendon2.htm" target="_blank">Virginia</a>.  How did we accumulate so much crap?  Why can we put a man on the moon, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeys_in_space" target="_blank">monkey into space</a>, and yet we still can&#8217;t teleport matter?  But I digress.</p>

<p>As excited as I am about working at LC, deciding to leave Princeton and the New Jersey area was not easy.  New Jersey&#8217;s my home state, where most of my friends and family still live, and though I keep moving away, I&#8217;ve wound up coming back each time.  (Insert obligatory Godfather &#8221;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/quotes" target="_blank">pull me back in</a>&#8221; impression.)  I was completely comfortable and very happy working at Princeton, where we were making real headway on building out the digital library.  I&#8217;ll miss my colleagues greatly &#8211; the people I met at Princeton were all friendly and created a laidback workplace.  I will miss our semi-regular lunches at <a href="http://www.triumphbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Triumph</a> brewery.</p>

<p>I have to thank <a href="http://kevinclarke.info/weblog/" target="_blank">Kevin Clarke</a> specifically for making my time a real joy.  He sheltered me and my colleague, <a href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/research/phd_students.aspx?id=7494" target="_blank">Parmit</a>, from a lot of administrivia and committees and meetings (oh my!), allowing us to concentrate on the job at hand, and was always supportive of our technology choices &#8211; I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve left a legacy at Princeton, namely saddling my replacement with a bunch of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> code and a couple <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a> apps.  I was especially thankful that Kevin and our administrators were fully behind my decision to release much of the <a href="http://diglib2.princeton.edu/oss" target="_blank">software</a> I wrote as open source (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" target="_blank">MIT/X11 license</a>).  They made the procedure an absolute snap, allowed me to retain copyright, and were flexible with regard to the choice of license.  As an open source neophyte, I appreciated the flexibility.</p>

<p>Time to hit the hay, and hope that tomorrow&#8217;s move goes smoothly.  We&#8217;ll have ten days to unpack and settle in, and I start at LC on the 29th of this month.  I noticed today that one of the big projects my team has been working on got a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/technology/18world.html" target="_blank">write-up</a> in the NY Times today (hat tip: <a href="http://www.inkdroid.org/journal/2007/10/18/tools-2/" target="_blank">Ed</a>).  I can&#8217;t wait to jump on board and start wrapping my mind around these projects.  I fully expect to be overwhelmed and challenged.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to it and I&#8217;ve got a great team to work with.  But for now, I&#8217;ve got to rest.  The movers will be here before I know it and we have a long day/week ahead of us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The hard drive on my laptop is slowly failing and a combination of being busy, lazy, and cheap is preventing me from replacing it.  About once every two weeks over the past couple months, one of the Windows registry files becomes corrupted and the XP disk is unable to repair it.  And the HD fails basic manufacturer-provided diagnostics.  But I&#8217;m stubborn.  So I&#8217;ve been routinely resuscitating this box and I decided to post the process I use.</p>

<p>If you boot and see a message like</p>

<blockquote>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt
C:\windows\system32\config\system</blockquote>


<p>then you may be interested in this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/" target="_blank">Dorothea</a> left a <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/09/11/code4lib-2007-review/#comment-45629" target="_blank">comment</a> on a <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/09/11/code4lib-2007-review/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the publication of a little <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/07419050710823247" target="_blank">conference review</a> some colleagues and I splurted out.  In the announcement I lamented a bit about impact and she wisely suggested I consider depositing the review in a subject repository such as <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/" target="_blank">E-LIS</a>.</p>

<p>We looked into our agreement with the publisher and it was actually quite permissive.  (Way to go, Emerald.)  And here&#8217;s the <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00011670/" target="_blank">review</a> in all its open access glory.</p>

<p>Thanks, Dorothea!</p>
