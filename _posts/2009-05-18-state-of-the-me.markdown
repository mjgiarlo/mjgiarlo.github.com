Has it really been two months?  Why, yes, it has.  Oh me, oh my.  I have tried to stick somewhat loosely to a schedule of writing here once a month ((Here I extend my hand and then imagine you, whomever you may be, smacking it ever so gently)), but alas, April came and went and I simply made no time to write.

That's not entirely true; I did plenty of writing:

I wrote <a href="http://www.wdl.org/">code</a>.  After a year of working on the World Digital Library project at <a href="http://loc.gov/">$MPOW</a>, we went live on April 21st.  The last few weeks were very busy for the development team, but I did find a few moments to breathe and blink.

I wrote <a href="http://identi.ca/mjgiarlo">microblog</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo">updates</a>.  After months of trying to figure out what microblogging is all about ((Wondered: Is it IM?  Status updates?  Blogging?  And how is it related to these?  Concluded: it's a little of each, and somehow it fits my status/vanity/sharing needs perfectly.)), it found its way into my daily routine.  When time is short or thoughts arise fast and fuzzy, microblogging is a useful public scratchpad.

I wrote <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/presentations/njla2009/">slides</a>.  The kind folks over at the College and University Section of the New Jersey Library Association invited me to be a panelist at the <a href="http://njla.pbworks.com/Conference+2009">2009 NJLA conference</a>.  The panel addressed recentish developments in open source integrated library systems.  I spoke about the <a href="http://evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen ILS</a> ((Hat tip to <a href="http://esilibrary.com/">Equinox Software Inc.</a>'s <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">Karen G. Schneider</a> for her kind assistance.)) and my co-panelists spoke about <a href="http://koha.org/">Koha</a> and the <a href="http://oleproject.org/">Open Library Environment Project</a>.

And, ever the dutiful technologist, I wrote documentation.  And that will be the subject of <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/05/19/i2-background/">my next post</a>.
