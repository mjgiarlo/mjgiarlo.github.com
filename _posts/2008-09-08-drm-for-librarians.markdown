I know precious little about rights management.Â  And what I do know I have gleaned from the occasional Slashdot post or Wired article.Â  Former colleague Grace Agnew, Associate University Librarian for Digital Library Systems at Rutgers University, has put the wraps on a book about digital rights management targeted at librarians, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Management-Librarians-Technology-Practise/dp/other-editions/1843341824" target="_blank">Digital Rights Management: A Librarian's Guide to Technology and Practice</a> (also available in paperback):
<blockquote>This book provides an overview of the current landscape in digital rights management (DRM), including: an overview of terminology and issues facing libraries, plus an overview of the technology (including standards and off-the-shelf products). It discusses the role and implications of DRM for existing library services, such as integrated library management systems, electronic reserves, commercial database licenses, digital asset management systems and digital library repositories. It also discusses the impact that DRM â€˜trusted systemâ€™ technologies, already in use in complementary areas, such as course management systems and web-based digital media distribution, may have on libraries. It also discusses strategies for implementing DRM in libraries and archives for safeguarding intellectual property in the web environment.</blockquote>
If you're a librarian or information professional looking for an introduction to DRM, an underpinning for rights management strategy, or a refresher on rights management technologies, you might consider checking it out.

For full disclosure, I was one of several reviewers of this book.
