I've finally gotten around to updating the unAPI plugin for WordPress so that it fits into the WordPress plugin architecture, making it simple to install and maintain. I'm calling it version 1.0 since it's the first substantial release of the plugin since I got involved.  Just unzip that sucker (or check the code out) to wp-content/plugins/unapi and do the rest via the administration pages, including activation and identifier configuration.

I updated the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/unapi-wordpress-plug-in/">plugin page</a> and imported it into the <a target="_blank" href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/unapi/trunk/">svn repo</a> hosted at wp-plugins.org.

This was my first WP plugin, so I would appreciate any feedback.  All you folks that are using it should try stripping out the old version (which requires hacking some theme files) and plugging this in.
