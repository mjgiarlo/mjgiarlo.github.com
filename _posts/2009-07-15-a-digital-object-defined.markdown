What happens to a digital object defined? ((Inspired by Langston Hughes's "<a href="http://www.cswnet.com/~menamc/langston.htm">A Dream Deferred</a>" and a spirited <a href="http://twitter.com/dchud/status/2656720839">conversation</a> in the office today.))<br/>
<br/>
Does its identifier dry up<br/>
like a raisin in the sun?<br/>
Or its relationships fester like a sore--<br/>
And then run?<br/>
Do its bits rot like meat?<br/>
Or become overwritten--<br/>
like some throw-away sheet?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its metadata just sags<br/>
like a heavy load.<br/>
<br/>
Or does it fade into code?
